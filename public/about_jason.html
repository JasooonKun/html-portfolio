<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi Guys I'm Earl Jason Pe√±alosa an future web developer, I have a bachelor degree
  of Computer science and Graduated last 2018. I like playing computer games such Dota2, Counter strike valorant etc. I am also playing console games like nintendo switch.
  for my personality I think I am a Introvert person because sometimes I feel shy speaking myself in some people that I'm to meet, but thank God I almost overcome it how? during my previous work experience
  which is not an IT job it more in HR jobs I face some different kind of person everyday to overcome my shy personality.
  I think I can work under pressure because I prove it also during past job and of course at the end of the day I'm wasted and tired due to
  toxic kind of work but It's okay because that for my future, now I'm starting learning again programing or coding because I realize that this is the career 
  that I want, actually I want to become an IT service helpdesk job but I think it is better to add more skills in programming.
  
  Thank you for reading everything about myself I hope I become successful before I aged 40's.<br/>
